## Notes

- Using Unix, if you want to, say, change directory to a directory whose name contains a space, you must include a `\` before the space, otherwise it wont be recognized. You don't have to do that if you're using Windows.

- Pattern matching works pretty much the same under Windows, but someone who would run into trouble could take a look [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/networking/technologies/nps/nps-crp-reg-expressions) for more information.

- Some additional documentation can be found [here](http://www.yolinux.com/TUTORIALS/unix_for_dos_users.html) (english) or [there](http://archive.download.redhat.com/pub/redhat/linux/7.1/it/doc/RH-DOCS/fr/rhl-gsg-fr-7.1/ch-doslinux.html) (french).
