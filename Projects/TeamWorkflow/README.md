# practicals

This is a mix of what I learned about git so far from the course & from various sources on the internet.

The workflow.md file is a step by step guide for using git as a tool to work with teammates on the same project.

This is a first version and will probably be updated during the course.

students are welcome to contribute to it upon interest.
